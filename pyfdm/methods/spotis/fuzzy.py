    """
        Calculates the alternatives preferences based on Triangular Fuzzy Number extension

        Parameters
        ----------
            matrix : ndarray
                Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

            weights : ndarray
                Vector of criteria weights in a crisp form

            normalization: callable
                Function used to normalize the decision matrix

            bounds : ndarray
                Decision problem bounds / criteria bounds. Should be two dimensional array with [min, max] value for in criterion in rows.

            isp : ndarray
                Vector of Ideal Solution Point
                
        Returns
        -------
            ndarray:
                Crisp preferences of alternatives
